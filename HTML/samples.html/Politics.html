 <p> Political parties in Nigeria, especially the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and
 All Progressives Congress (APC) have been charged to choose their presidential 
 candidates among contestants of the Southeast extraction for equity, justice and 
 balancing purposes.</p>

<p>The group, PDP Coalition, in a statement by Dr. Emeka Kalu, its Coordinator, 
lamented that since political independence in 1960, none of the southeast origins
 had ever been voted as the president of the country, despite the division of Nigeria 
 into six geo-political regions.</p>

<p>The group insisted that Mr. Peter Obi and Sen. Pius Anyim, the former Governor of 
Anambra State and former Senate President, respectively for instance from the PDP have the 
capacity and mental ability to transform the Nigerian economy and make it competitive with 
others across the globe.</p>

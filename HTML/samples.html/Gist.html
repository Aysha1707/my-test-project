    <img src="../my images/obi face.PNG" alt="500*500">
    <p>Bayo a university undergraduate of a reknown university in Nigeria finally 
        speak out about his ex-girlfriend of 4years who got pregnant for his younger brother.
    He said he and his ex had been in this relationship for long and the relationship is at the stage of introduction.
     He said he observed that this girl started her waywardness and developing strange attributes at any moment she feels like. 
     He started monitoring her movements and messages time to time unknown to the girl. 
     There was a time he caught her on a call with his younger brother talking explicitly and he ignored just because it was his 
     sibling. These things kept occuring till one day he(the younger brother)requested to take her out on a date, she seek for permission that 
     she want to go visit her mother and the boyfriend agreed unkowingly.
     As this kept on going, she had made 3 ab*rtions for this younger brother without the elders knowledge.
     Now, its over 10 months we last had anything together and shes claiming shes pregnant for me! Alas!, I haven't touched her for almost a year 
     because of her unclean ways(Man needs to protect himself na). 
     After series of questioning, she didnt say the truth till I cajoled her with a red cloth tied round a cow horn just to scare her, she later voiced 
     out that She's sorry for what happened that she had been in love with my younger brother for long and thier relationship together is over 2years. 
     I asked her to leave my house and I've made it known to my brother not to call me or relate himself with me again. Am done with any f*ck!ng 
     relationship. Women are sc*m and am cool being single.

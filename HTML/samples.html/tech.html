    <h2>YOUTH GROUPS LAUNCHES TECH PLATFORM..</h2>
    <p>Youth group launches tech platform to help Nigerians track politicians campaign promises</p> <br>
    <p>The National Park Foundation's premier partners L.L.Bean, Nature Valley, Tupperware Brands, Subaru of America, and Union Pacific Railroad
         are joining in the National Park Week celebration by sharing examples of the ways they help NPF achieve its goals to protect wildlife and 
         park lands, preserve history and culture, educate and engage youth, and connect people everywhere to the wonder of parks.

        From reducing waste, to increasing recycling efforts, to accommodating electric vehicles and minimizing air pollution in parks and gateway
         communities, the National Park Foundation partners with industry leaders like Subaru of America to harness the power of 
        technology and innovation to help ensure parks thrive today and into the future.
        
        "Subaru owners have a deep connection with national parks, which is one reason why Subaru has long been committed to helping national parks
         become more sustainable," said Alan Bethke, senior vice president of marketing, Subaru of America, Inc. "We're proud to continue to help 
         our 
         parks respond to complex problems through electric vehicle innovations, allowing national park visitors to explore the great outdoors and 
         protect 
         them at the same time and helping the miles traveled between visits to have less impact on the environment."
        
        Recognizing that park visitation is projected to increase in the years ahead and will likely be concentrated in the most well-known parks,
         the National Park Foundation partners with brands like L.L.Bean to help the National Park Service plan for the needs of parks and park visitors 
         in the future, expand the ways people can experience parks, and highlight the rich opportunities that lesser-known parks offer as well.
        
        "At L.L.Bean, our purpose is to inspire and enable people to experience the restorative power of being outside," said Shawn Gorman, executive 
        chairman of L.L.Bean and great-grandson of Leon Leonwood Bean. "Our purpose extends beyond our products to include stewardship of our natural 
        resources. 
        By investing in the National Park Foundation and specifically, the Parks of the Future initiative, we can ensure the natural resources we enjoy 
        today are available to us tomorrow."
        
        Together with partners like Nature Valley, the National Park Foundation supports programs and activities that help people create and strengthen 
        life-long relationships with national parks, bringing people together for joy-filled and meaningful experiences outdoors.
        
        "When you discover the wonder of nature, you're likely to help protect it," said Ray Joncas, vice president of snack bars at General Mills. 
        "Nature Valley is committed to preserving nature for future generations to enjoy, and we're proud to partner with the National Park Foundation 
        to help expand access and advance equity so that all communities can get out there and experience the benefits and beauty of national parks."
        
        Understanding a universal desire for more sustainable options, the National Park Foundation partners with brands like Tupperware to invest in 
        projects such as composting and installing water refill stations that support the National Park Service's goal to divert 50 percent of waste from 
        landfills annually.  
        
        "Now more than ever, the planet needs our help and we are so proud of the partnership and support we have been able to provide across some of 
        America's most treasured places and spaces – national parks! Whether it's installing new water bottle refill stations or supporting recycling and 
        composting programs, preserving national parks enables current and future generations to experience and be inspired by nature's beauty," 
        said Cherisse Stover, senior manager, Tupperware Brands Foundation & Social Impact. "Through our partnership, we hope park-goers are mindful of what 
        they take into and out of the parks. Consider a reusable food container and a reusable water bottle instead of single-use items. Together, we can 
        preserve national parks for generations and generations to come."

        Across the country, the National Park Foundation is making educational park experiences accessible for more students, thanks to the support of partners like Union Pacific Railroad.
        
        "Union Pacific is proud to have provided thousands of students from diverse backgrounds the opportunity to explore and discover national parks through Open OutDoors for Kids, a signature National Park Foundation program," said Scott Moore, senior vice president – corporate relations and chief administrative officer at Union Pacific. "National parks are vibrant, living laboratories that spark curiosity and inspire the next generation."
        
        The National Park Foundation also celebrates the ways in which it works with partners and donors to help preserve history and culture in parks, support native wildlife and critical ecosystems, and build the capacity of a growing and robust community of more than 450 park partners.  
        
        Through programs like the African American Experience Fund and Latino Heritage Fund, the National Park Foundation and its partners help people gain a broader understanding of history through a vast range of perspectives and voices, see themselves reflected in parks, and understand how parks connect to their personal identities and lives. As part of this work, the National Park Foundation supports efforts including dynamic educational programs, professional development opportunities, rehabilitation of historic sites, and the preservation – both physically and digitally – of irreplaceable artifacts and places.
        
        The National Park Foundation and its partners support vital efforts to study and protect the most biologically diverse landscapes in the country, ensuring the health and vibrancy of park environments that are home to a wide variety of wildlife including bison, wolves, bald eagles, and California condors.
        
        The National Park Foundation is committed to increasing national park philanthropy across the board and being responsive to current park needs. Through programs like Strong Parks, Strong Communities, the National Park Foundation is helping advance park partners' goals to preserve natural and cultural resources, increase access to public lands for all people, and develop innovative programming.
        
        In addition to the National Park Foundation's premier partners, signature partner The Coca-Cola Company and supporting partners Carhartt, GoGo squeeZ, History Channel, Niantic, Sun Outdoors, and Winnebago Industries are also joining NPF in celebrating National Park Week 2022.

    <h3>Two Trends In Tech 2022—And One That Should Be</h3>
    <p>Tech has never been more futuristic than it is right now. Mark Zuckerberg is building a metaverse,
         Andreessen Horowitz wants a third generation of the internet, Jeff Bezos is space-traveling, 
         Google’s founders are investing in flying taxis and Elon Musk wants to establish a civilization
          on Mars. <br>
         
        These are truly exciting times, and I admire their ambitions.
        
        But as New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose wrote last year, it is as if some tech moguls are 
        “getting bored and restless with their jobs.” I, at least, have had the thought that we are witnessing
         a sort of internal tech-lash, most prominent in the discussions around Web3 and the metaverse, where 
         some tech founders are leaving their old inventions behind either because they don’t feel like fixing
          the problems they have caused or simply because they are tired of managing them.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, there is an external tech lash coming from a youth culture that wants to take it down 
        a nudge. Whether it’s the practical wired-it girls or people buying old cell phones to preach digital 
        wellness. For at least a few weeks, the internet has been buzzing about an ongoing vibe shift, where 
        people want to “make things personal again” and “move away from Silicon Valley’s interest in optimizing 
        workflow.” <br>
        <img src="../my images/960x0.jpg" alt="100*30"> <br>
        Two completely contrary trends—an extreme futurism and a sort of neo-analog lifestyle—seem to have emerged
         at the same time, and they both seem to stem from a discontentment with the current tech industry. However,
          none of these reactions are optimal. They have an element of escapism in them.

    <p> We did some questionings and we were told there was no power supply for months and they(PHCN officials) came 
         with enormous bills with the intention of disconnecting the wires. 
         On no account will they do that says the community head, that argument led to the ugly scene.
         One of the PHCN official was badly injured but was taken to the nearby hospital for proper care.
